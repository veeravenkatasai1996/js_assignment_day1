2.String: “Hello GeeksforGeeks” etc.<br>
3.Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.<br>
4.Null: This type has only one value : null.<br>
5.Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.<br>
6.Object: It is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
